    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
      This is a wonderful egg and hash brown breakfast casserole that will feed
      many. We have it every year for Christmas brunch. It's also very easy to increase the portion by putting it into a 9x13-inch
      dish and just adding extra ingredients.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (20 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
      <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage</li>
      <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded pepper jack cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 thin slices tomato</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Toss potatoes with vegetable oil in a bowl until potatoes are well
        coated. Press potatoes into a 10-inch pie pan to create a crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30
        minutes. Remove pan from oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While potatoes are baking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat
        and stir in sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly
        browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.
        Combine sausage with eggs, mushrooms, pepper jack cheese, Swiss cheese,
        milk, 1 tablespoon parsley, garlic salt, and black pepper in a large
        bowl. Pour egg mixture into the prepared potato crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the oven until eggs are set, about 25 minutes. Arrange tomato
        slices over eggs and sprinkle the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley on
        top. Return to the oven and continue baking until tomatoes soften, about
        5 minutes more.
